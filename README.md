## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://beckamcnally.github.io/Word-Guess/)
This is a word guess game built using JavaScript. The user starts the game by clicking on a button, then tries to guess a word by filling in a number of blanks that match the number of letters in that word. The game is timed, and the user wins by guessing all the letters in the word before the timer runs out. The user loses the game when the timer runs out before all letters are guessed. The game displays the total wins and losses of the user on the screen.

## Usage 
To play the game, simply click on the "Start" button to start the game. You will then see a series of blanks representing the letters of a word you are to guess. Type a letter on your keyboard to guess a letter. If the letter you guessed is correct, the corresponding blank is replaced by the letter. If the letter is incorrect, the number of remaining guesses will decrease. You win the game when you successfully guess all the letters in the word before the timer runs out, and you lose the game if the timer runs out before you have guessed all the letters.

## Learning Points 

* Capture user input using JavaScript.
* Manipulate the DOM to update the display of a web page.
* Use of JavaScript timing events to create a timer.
* Use of conditional statements to create a win/lose scenario in a game.
* Store data locally so that it persists between browser refreshes.
